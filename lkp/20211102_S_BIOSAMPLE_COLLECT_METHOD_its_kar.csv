1,1,Kick: Standard,"Kick sampling is limited to wadable areas of flowing waters where hardbottom substrate is dominated by rock, cobble, and coarse gravel. Kick sampling uses an aquatic net (size 9 in. X 18 in., mesh opening size .8 mm X .9 mm) positioned in the water about 0.5 m downstream and the stream bottom is disturbed by foot, so that the dislodged organisms are carried into the net. Sampling is continued for 5 minutes for a distance of 5 meters. The preferred line of sampling is a diagonal transect of the stream. "
2,2,Multiplate: Navigable,"Multiplates are artificial-substrate sampling device developed by Hester and Dendy (1962). They are used in flowing waters too deep for kick sampling. Multiplate sampler are made from 3 (15.2 cm) square pieces of tempered hardboard. These are stacked along a central shaft such that between the outer most piece and middle piece there is a 0.3 cm space and 0.9 cm space between the middle and inner most piece. Multiplates are suspended 1 meter deep for a 5-week colonization period from a navigation buoy, or surface float affixed to a bottom anchor. This method is applied where navigation buoys are used."
3,3,Sediment Ponar,"The use of the Ponar grab sampler or Petite Ponar grab sampler provides a quantitative sample of soft sediments in rivers or lakes. The sampler is designed to penetrate the substrate by its own weight and enclose a portion of the bottom by means of a gravity-activated closing mechanism. The standard Ponar measures nine inches on each side, enclosing a surface area of 0.56 square feet (0.052 square meters). The Petite Ponar measures six inches on each side, enclosing a surface area of 0.25 square feet (0.023 square meters). "
4,4,Other: Various (Historical),Samples collected as 'other' are atypical collection methods historically used where no standard method has yet been developed.
5,5,Multiplate: Non-Navigable,Multiplates are artificial-substrate sampling device developed by Hester and Dendy (1962). They are used in flowing waters too deep for kick sampling. Multiplate sampler are made from 3 (15.2 cm) square pieces of tempered hardboard. These are stacked along a central shaft such that between the outer most piece and middle piece there is a 0.3 cm space and 0.9 cm space between the middle and inner most piece. Multiplates are suspended 1 meter deep for a 5-week colonization period from a surface float affixed to a bottom anchor. This method is applied where navigation buoys are not used.
6,6,Kick: Sandy Stream,"Kick sampling is limited to wadable areas of flowing waters where current speeds exceed 40 cm/sec and riffles exist, but substrate composition is composed primarily of gravel and sand. Kick sampling uses an aquatic net (size 9 in. X 18 in., mesh opening size .8 mm X .9 mm) positioned in the water about 0.5 m downstream and the stream bottom is disturbed by foot, so that the dislodged organisms are carried into the net. Sampling is continued for 5 minutes for a distance of 5 meters. The preferred line of sampling is a diagonal transect of the stream. "
7,7,Kick: Headwater Stream,"Kick sampling is limited to wadable areas of flowing waters where current speeds exceed 40 cm/sec and riffles exist, but substrate composition is composed primarily of gravel and sand. Kick sampling uses an aquatic net (size 9 in. X 18 in., mesh opening size .8 mm X .9 mm) positioned in the water about 0.5 m downstream and the stream bottom is disturbed by foot, so that the dislodged organisms are carried into the net. Sampling is continued for 5 minutes for a distance of 5 meters. The preferred line of sampling is a diagonal transect of the stream. Application of headwater stream assessment methods are applied to streams meeting headwater criteria defined in the NYS DEC SOP ""Biological Monitoring of Surface Waters in New York State""; for example, drainage area, elevation, wetland cover and geographic location."
8,8, Multihabitat: Lake,"Samples from 8 equidistant littoral zone locations around the waterbody and composited. Littoral habitat type and riparian condition assessment are evaluated from each sampling location to relate overall riparian and littoral condition to macroinvertebrate condition. Samples taken are taken at a depth of 1 m and 5–10 m from shore toward the center of the lake. Distance from shore can be adjusted where lake conditions demand (i.e. very sharp or very gradual drop off in depth). Samples are collected using a kick net (net dimensions 23x46 cm, mesh size 0.8 mm x 0.9 mm). A 1-minute kick sample is collected by disturbing the bottom substrate of the dominant habitat in the littoral zone and sweeping the net through the water column over a 1x1 m area. Sample compositing is performed using a sieve bucket."
9,9,Low-Gradient,"Low-Gradient is a method of sampling benthic organisms by disturbing bottom and bank sediments, macrophyte and woody debris at locations where currents <=40 cm/sec and bottoms are largely composed of soft sediments. A composite of 4 habitats; two jab/kick/sweeps of each (8 samples in total): bank, center channel substrate, woody debris/snags and macrophyte bed. Each of 8 jab/kick/sweeps is sampled for 30 seconds over an area of approximately 0.5 square meters (4 minutes and 4 m^2 total for all 8 samples). This is completed using an aquatic net (size 23 x 46 cm., mesh opening size .8 mm X .9 mm). All collected material from best available habitats is composited using a sieve bucket."
10,10,Multihabitat: Diatom,"All major benthic habitats available are sampled for diatoms (stones, macrophytes and mud) and are composited into a single, multi-habitat sample (MHS). Epilithon communities are scraped from pebbles, cobbles and boulders with a knife. Epiphyton communities are collected from nonvascular and vascular plants by adding the whole plant (or parts of it) to the MHS. Epipelon communities are sampled using a pipette to suction up the brown flocculent material occurring on the surface of mud. All samples are placed in a vial and preserved with 4% formaldehyde in the field."
11,11,Electrofishing Fish Shocking,"Fish sampling is conducted in wadable streams and consists of electro-fishing a single stream reach equal to 20x the stream wetted width of the stream, with a minimum reach length of 75 meters and a maximum of 250 meters. A reach that cannot be effectively sampled using a single backpack electro-shocker will be sampled from one bank out to 8-10 meters. A diversity of habitats including riffles, pools, snags, and undercut banks are sampled in a single pass with a backpack electro-shocker. Fish are collected and placed into a basketed net where they cannot escape but are adequately supplied with fresh water. Sampling reaches are isolated with block nets in the absence of natural barriers. Seining may also be used where electrofishing is not possible. Fish are identified and enumerated at the site and released. Salmonids are measured and enumerated. All specimens are counted and examined for external anomalies such as deformities, eroded fins, lesions and tumors."

The sampler is designed to penetrate the substrate by its own weight and enclose a portion of the bottom by means of a gravity-activated closing mechanism.

The Petite Ponar measures six inches on each side, enclosing a surface area of 0.25 square feet (0.023 square meters). Samples of this type collected for the purposes of lake biomonitoring are most often included in a composite combined using a sieve bucket."
14,14,Lake: Littoral,"Covers the of a kick net method for the colleciton of a lake macroinvertebrate samples. This method applies to all lake biomonitong sampling as described by the multihabitat lake sampling method. Littoral habitat type and riparian condition assessment are evaluated at the sampling location to relate overall riparian and littoral condition to macroinvertebrate condition. Samples are taken at a depth of 1 m and 5–10 m from shore toward the center of the lake. Distance from shore can be adjusted where lake conditions demand (i.e. very sharp or very gradual drop off in depth).
